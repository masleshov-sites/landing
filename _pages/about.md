I'm a software developer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry. During my career, I worked in different fields such as fintech, banking, insurance, accounting and even aluminum industry. Basically, I use C# and Java in my work, but also I have a commercial experience with Golang and Node.js.

The most challenging projects I have been involved in are a [broker trading system](https://warp.alor.dev/en) where I was responsible for market data connectors to stock exchanges and [a vast Russian financial marketplace](https://finuslugi.ru) where I developed the backend for a mobile application from scratch and brought it to release.

Having been a team-leader, I gained the experience of people management, ability to meet deadlines and skill of effective communications. 

My hard skills and knowledge allow me to solve any task in any technologies, but what I do best is high-loaded backend development, integrations with any third-party systems, architectural design of complex systems.
